This is my reminder, how to use webpack. <br />
current installation : <br />
npm -v 3.10.10 <br />
node -v 6.10.3 <br />
webpack -v  2.6.1 <br />
How to use it: <br />
1.npm install <br />
2.npm run sync == sync from package.json (put scripts from src to dist) <br />
3.npm run sync == dev from package.json (put scripts from src to dist, run watch) <br />
4.npm run prod == prod from package.json (do the same do the same job as dev, but compress scripts). <br />
4.npm run serve == serve from package.json (run dev server on localhost:3310 )<br />
