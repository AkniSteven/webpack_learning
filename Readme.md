This is my reminder, how to use webpack.
current installation :
npm -v 3.10.10
node -v 6.10.3
webpack -v  2.6.1
How to use it:
1.npm install
2.npm run dev == dev from package.json (put scripts from src to dist, run watch)
3.npm run prod == prod from package.json (do the same do the same job as dev, but minify scripts).
